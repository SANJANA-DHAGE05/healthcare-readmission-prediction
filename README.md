# 🏥 Healthcare Readmission Prediction for Diabetes Patients

An end-to-end Healthcare Analytics & Machine Learning project focused on predicting **30-day hospital readmissions** for diabetes patients using real-world clinical data.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Hospital readmissions within 30 days are a major healthcare challenge. They increase operational costs and often indicate suboptimal patient management.

This project builds a complete analytics pipeline — from raw healthcare data to predictive modeling and dashboard-ready insights — to identify high-risk patients and support proactive clinical decisions.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

To predict whether a diabetes patient will be readmitted within 30 days of hospital discharge and identify key factors contributing to readmission risk.

### 💡 Impact

- Reduce hospital penalties  
- Improve patient care quality  
- Optimize resource allocation  
- Enable data-driven healthcare strategy  

---

## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Dataset:** Diabetes 130-US Hospitals (1999–2008)  
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Records:** 100,000+ patient encounters  
- **Features:** 50+ clinical & administrative attributes  

---

## 📥 Dataset Setup Instructions

Due to size limitations, the dataset is not uploaded.

1. Download `diabetic_data.csv` from the UCI ML Repository.  
2. Place it inside the project folder


3. Run the notebook or Python scripts.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- XGBoost (if used)

# 🔄 Project Workflow

---

## 1️⃣ Data Acquisition & Validation

- Loaded raw clinical dataset  
- Assessed data structure & data types  
- Identified missing values  
- Validated target variable distribution  

---

## 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

- Removed invalid entries (e.g., '?')  
- Treated missing values  
- Feature engineering  
- Encoded categorical variables  
- Data normalization (if applicable)  

Created cleaned dataset:


---

## 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Comprehensive statistical and visual exploration was performed.

### 📊 Key Visualizations Created

- Target distribution  
- Numeric feature distributions  
- Categorical feature distributions  
- Admission type vs readmission  
- Correlation matrix  
- Risk stratification analysis  
- Probability distribution plots  

All saved under:visualizations folder


---

## 📈 Major Insights

- Readmission distribution is imbalanced  
- Inpatient & emergency visit count strongly influence readmission  
- Age groups show varying risk levels  
- Certain medications correlate with higher readmission probability  
- Length of stay impacts outcome significantly  

---

## 4️⃣ Model Building & Evaluation

Multiple classification models were trained and compared:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost (if implemented)  

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics Used

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall (Critical for healthcare)  
- F1-Score  
- ROC-AUC  
- Confusion Matrix  

Healthcare problems prioritize **Recall** to minimize false negatives (missing high-risk patients).

---

## 🧠 Feature Importance Analysis

### 🔍 Top Predictors Identified

- Number of inpatient visits  
- Number of emergency visits  
- Age group  
- Medication changes  
- Diagnosis category
